    "The last block of code provides a function for modifying the time step. In general this should not be touched, but it allows for your time step to be made altered in regions where it's hard to accurately obtain the likelihood function. For example, if your drift/threshold functions have discontinuities in them, it can sometimes be helpful to add a time step modification locally around it.  If it outputs 1, the time step is not modified; if it recieves a value of less than 1, the time step will get smaller; if it outputs a value more than 1; the time step will grow. For example, if it returns 0.5, the time step will be one-half of its normal value.\n",
