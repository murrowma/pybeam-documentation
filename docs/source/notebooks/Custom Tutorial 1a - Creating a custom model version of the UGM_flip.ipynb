    "# Custom Tutorial 1a: Creating a custom model version of the UGM_flip model\n",

    "Once PyBEAM is installed, we can create our model. First, download the folder \"custom_model_template.zip\" and unzip it. Then, create a new folder anywhere on your device and copy the files located in folder \"custom_model_template\" to it. There will be three files you need to copy: \"setup.py\", \"functions.pyx\", and \"model.pyx\". The only file that needs to be modified is \"model.pyx\". DO NOT TOUCH THE OTHER TWO FILES.\n",

    "In this file, we create the UGM_flip model contained in the PyBEAM publication and PyBEAM's precoded model set. It has the following 8 parameters:\n",

    "    'tnd': non-decision time\n",
    "    'w': relative start point\n",
    "    'mu': drift rate\n",
    "    'l': leakage rate\n",
    "    'k': urgency parameter\n",
    "    'sigma': scaling parameter\n",
    "    't_flip': time when mu changes sign\n",
    "    'b': decision threshold location (upper is at b, lower is\n",
    "         at -b; separation is 2b)\n",
